            <h1>Software</h1>
            <p>"Honestly, the biggest scam in digital design is to make you believe that production software like InDesign and Illustrator are actually 'creative softwares' [but] they are not and it's the same in type design. Production software does not make better typefaces and does not help you make better creative decisions, so don't sweat too much the technique. It will be all fine if techniques are well-documented..." (Jean-Baptiste Levée, lecture from Element Talks conference, Warsaw 2017) <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghFMlnjaJrg">link</a></p>

            <h1>Systems</h1>
            <p>"2. Focus on systems, not letters.
                In typeface design, there’s nothing inherently valuable about a really pretty letter: the goal is to have letters that give rise to handsome and enticing paragraphs. Train yourself not to look at letterforms, but at contexts: how one letter visually relates to the others, how it’s distinguished from its closest relatives, and how it cozies up to every possible neighbor. Always be looking at the larger context: judge letters by looking at words, words by looking at paragraphs, and paragraphs by looking at manuscripts." ('Getting Started with Typeface Design', Jonathan Hoefler) <a href="https://jonathanhoefler.com/articles/getting-started-with-typeface-design">link</a></p>

            <p>"The single biggest issue that makes type design different is the need for every glyph in the typeface to work with every other glyph. This often means that the design and spacing of each part of the typeface ends up being a series of careful compromises. These compromises mean that we can best think about typeface design as the creation of a wonderful collection of letters but not as a collection of wonderful letters. In other words we must think about the group and how it will perform together and prioritize this over any question of what is wonderful in a single letter. ¶ This need to prioritize with the system rather than with any single part also leads to a need to analyze our design process on the level of the system. Characteristics which span letters become the things we want to focus on, particularly at the beginning of the design process."

            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <p>Lubalin never liked the term ‘typographer’, finding it too reductive. ‘Typographics’ – a word coined by Burns – was, he said, ‘as good a name for what I do as any.’ <a href="www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/up-close-and-tight">link</a></p>

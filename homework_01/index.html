            <h1>Software</h1>
            <p>"Honestly, the biggest scam in digital design is to make you believe that production software like InDesign and Illustrator are actually 'creative softwares' [but] they are not and it's the same in type design. Production software does not make better typefaces and does not help you make better creative decisions, so don't sweat too much the technique. It will be all fine if techniques are well-documented..." (Jean-Baptiste Levée, lecture from Element Talks conference, Warsaw 2017) <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghFMlnjaJrg">link</a></p>

            <h1>Systems</h1>
            <p>"2. Focus on systems, not letters.
                In typeface design, there’s nothing inherently valuable about a really pretty letter: the goal is to have letters that give rise to handsome and enticing paragraphs. Train yourself not to look at letterforms, but at contexts: how one letter visually relates to the others, how it’s distinguished from its closest relatives, and how it cozies up to every possible neighbor. Always be looking at the larger context: judge letters by looking at words, words by looking at paragraphs, and paragraphs by looking at manuscripts." ('Getting Started with Typeface Design', Jonathan Hoefler) <a href="https://jonathanhoefler.com/articles/getting-started-with-typeface-design">link</a></p>

            <p>"The single biggest issue that makes type design different is the need for every glyph in the typeface to work with every other glyph. This often means that the design and spacing of each part of the typeface ends up being a series of careful compromises. These compromises mean that we can best think about typeface design as the creation of a wonderful collection of letters but not as a collection of wonderful letters. In other words we must think about the group and how it will perform together and prioritize this over any question of what is wonderful in a single letter. ¶ This need to prioritize with the system rather than with any single part also leads to a need to analyze our design process on the level of the system. Characteristics which span letters become the things we want to focus on, particularly at the beginning of the design process."

            <h1>Format</h1>
            <p>Some invisible standards committee recently decided that eight to 10 episodes is the optimal length for a streaming series. Often, it is! (I was one of those critics who used to praise British TV for making two six-episode, no-filler seasons and calling it a day.) <a href="https://nyti.ms/3KMYSvP">link</a></p>

            <h1>Vibe</h1>
            <p>“It’s very fun because at first we don’t know what stream they are from. So our vibe is the same, because we are in the same class, and we just bond by talking and laughing.” <a href="www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/full-sbb-subject-based-banding-mixed-form-classes-subjects-secondary-school-3296141">link</a></p>
            <p>This was therefore less an exhibition than what my colleague Siddhartha Mitter, reviewing the show in June, adeptly called “a whole vibe.” Vibing was its aim, and its downfall too. Documenta 15, by design, militated against its own viewing — “the viewer is obsolete,” you can read in the catalog — because the real work of the show was not the stuff on the walls but the hanging out around it. In other words, the actual content and form of these Palestinian agitational movies from the 1970s and 1980s mattered less than the new collective group that brought them here, and the other artists who came together to vibe with them. Collectivity was treated as an end in itself: We were here, as ruangrupa exhorted us, to “Make friends, not art!” <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Uy6erm ">link</a></p>

            <p>“Don’t get me wrong, I love a chunky ‘Dunk,’” said Dr. Colleary, who was not involved in the new study. “But I’m not going to get too attached because in science, especially paleontology, it just takes one new discovery to change everything.” <a href="https://nyti.ms/3yctzoE">link</a></p>

            <p>The police came armed with tear gas, even though its use at games is prohibited by FIFA, soccer’s global governing body. Owen West, a senior lecturer on policing at the Edge Hill University in Britain, said the use of crowd control munitions and full riot gear “becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy” because officers’ “tactical assumptions are all initiated around a sense of losing control.” <a href="https://nyti.ms/3CABQpz">link</a></p>

            <h1>Avatar</h1>
            <p>... Though perhaps the greater boost came in 1992 with the sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson’s cyberpunktilious novel “Snow Crash,” where he invented his own online jargon. He called his virtual world “the Metaverse” and its digital inhabitants “avatars.” Stephenson later gave credit for the coinage to Morningstar and Farmer in the book’s paperback edition. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/magazine/10wwln-guest-t.html">link</a></p>

            <h1>Reinvention</h1>
            <p>The promise of reinvention is a core American value: the belief that everyone has the right to a fresh start, that you are limited only by your imagination and abilities. It’s intrinsically linked to the promise of fashion, which likewise dangles the lure of a new you; of allowing you to try on different selves until you settle into one that feels right. <a href="https://nyti.ms/41FduoI">link</a></p>

            <h1>Pastiche</h1>
            <p>EZRA KLEIN: You have a nice a line in one of your pieces where you say GPT-3, which is the system underneath ChatGPT, is the king of pastiche. What is pastiche, first, and what do you mean by that?</p>
            <p>GARY MARCUS: It’s a kind of glorified cut and paste. Pastiche is putting together things kind of imitating a style. And in some sense, that’s what it’s doing. It’s imitating particular styles, and it’s cutting and pasting a lot of stuff. It’s a little bit more complicated than that. But to a first approximation, that’s what it’s doing is cutting and pasting things.</p>
            <p>There’s also a kind of template aspect to it. So it cuts and pastes things, but it can do substitutions, things that paraphrase. So you have A and B in a sequence, it finds something else that looks like A, something else that looks like B, and it puts them together. And its brilliance comes from that when it writes a cool poem. And also its errors come from that because it doesn’t really fully understand ... <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-gary-marcus.html">link</a></p>

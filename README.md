Online Workshops
Expand Your Typographic Potential on the Web
with Marie Otsuka
During this hands-on workshop using foundational web languages, we will explore typographic expression on the web.

This four-week workshop (running Thursday evenings from September 7 —28) is intended for designers new to typography in the browser and will cover how to control typography on the web. From standard typesetting to experimental techniques, we will learn various ways to work with digital type — ranging from loading a webfont to animating variable fonts. We will approach the browser as a creative medium by developing a single-serve website that demonstrates intentional typography, in both design and functionality. Instruction will cover ways to control visual composition and basic interactivity on the web, using HTML & CSS. Participants will need no prior knowledge of these languages for this workshop but should be prepared to dive into coding.
